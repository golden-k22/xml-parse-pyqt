# XML Object Builder using Python

### Starting Point
1. XML objects are held in a GitHub repository - in a 'component library' folder
2. These objects have two basic forms: text-based and tabular (i.e. variable array)
3. These objects are authored using Oxygen

### Requirement - Using Python
1. Based on a set of user inputs (via a screen-based UI), XML objects are to be drawn from the GitHub repository
2. Based on the user inputs, the XML objects may be modified e.g. text-based objects are combined or variables in tabular objects are populated
3. A single integrated XML object is thus created
4. This integrated XML object is to be stored in the GitHub repository - in a 'completed objects' folder

### How to run?
```
venv/Scripts/active
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main_window.py
```
